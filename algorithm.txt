Algorithm for doing a synthetic seismogram (synthetic gather or synthetic zero offset gather or convolutional model)

Input: Frequency for source wavelet, depth model for P velocity and density (optional***;if not provided will be considered constant and equal to 1, so that density will not influence the final result).  

1)Calculate the acoustic impedance matrix: AI=velocity*density.
2)Create a zero matrix with the same dimension of AI. Calculate the reflection coefficients: RC[1:,:]=(AI[1:,:]-AI[:-1,:])/(AI[1:,:]+AI[:-1,:])

3)Convert** from depth to two way time, obtaining a matrix (TWT). TWT has the same dimension of AI, velocity and density. It gives the time coordinate that each propety occurs.

4)Verify the TMAX=max(TWT[-1,:]). TMAX is the maximum time and it should be considered in order to have all the depth model considered in the final result. Each column must be resampled until TMAX.   

5)Choose the sampling time (ST), 2ms or 4ms are the more common. Calculate the number of lines of the TWT_RS(TWT resampled)=zeros(ceil(TMAX/ST)). TWT_RS[n]=TWT_RS[n-1]+ST; 

6)Take zeros(RC_ts(ceil(TMAX/ST),N)). For each column, do the following: 
	lim=ceil(TWT[-1,n]/ST)-1;
	i)Give RC[:,n], TWT[:,n], TWT_RS[0:lim,n], RC_ts[0:lim,n]  for a python interpolate function.
	ii)The result will be RC_ts[0:lim,n].
	iii)Then, take: if(TWT[-1,n]/ST-lim+1 /= 0) RC_ts[lim-1,n]=0. ##MAYBE UNNECESSARY, DEPENDS HOW THE INTERPOLATION WORKS##

6)Calculate the convolution of RC_ts with the wavelet****. The result has the length: len(RC_ts)+len(wavelet)-1

6)Cut len(wavelet)/2 from the beggining and from the end of the result. 

**Depth time (TWT - two way time) conversion
Input: P velocity model in depth, vertical discretization (dz,length between each line in the matrix-considered 1m if not given)
Output: matrix with the corresponding two way times for each depth

1)The first line is: TWT[0,:]=2*dz/velocity[0,:]
2)Second line: TWT[1,:]=TWT[0,:]+2*dz/velocity[1,:]
3)TWT[n,:]=TWT[n-1,:]+2*dz/velocity[n,:]

***Yilmaz, Ch.2, pg.165:"From well-log measurements, we find that the vertical density gradient often is much smaller than the vertical velocity gradient.Therefore, we often assume that the impedance contrast between rock layers is essentially due to the velocity contrast, only."
